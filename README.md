#This project is to animate pictures and videos for our machine learning course.

#We have also deployed our project on the cloud server at the following address:

#http://110.40.204.185:8501

#We get inspired from this project: "https://github.com/TachibanaYoshino/AnimeGAN" which uses tensorflow, but we implement it with pytorch and many new features have been added.

#Also, we get inspired form this web_app: "https://huggingface.co/spaces/akhaliq/AnimeGANv2"

#If you want to run our project, you can try "streamlit run app.py" , "python test.py" or "python video_anime.py", and the arguments are optional.

#What's more, we make it more for the animation of face pictures, you can try to run "demo.ipynb", thus you can directly see the comparison between the origin picture and the animated picture.
